A scientific library as an alternative for root

I plan to imiplement high performance computing to help improve scientific compyting.
In my year of working in a lab I was stuck with matlab and I just wasn't impressed.
I haven't worked a lot with root but I personally felt the project was kind of a mess

I plan to release this under the MIT License

I plan to move this project to my xOS-linux project as I plan to implement a scientific derivative.

Requirements:
 - glibc - I plan to implement some getopt stuff
 - gcc 5+ (Cuda support requires a gcc5 compiler)
 - python
 - golang

Features:
 - Cuda 8+
 - C
 - cudaOS (A psuedo operating system for running multiple science applications etc)

Potential features:
 - OpenCL
 - python
 - go
 - C++

 What would be helpful:
 - I am only working on frakenstien laptop that has a nvidia card. If others
 could test this or help my projects in general and donate so that I can invest
 in a personal workstation that is capable of managing all my projects :)
